# hig-doctor

Universal **Apple Human Interface Guidelines** compliance auditor for app projects. Scans your source against **382 HIG rules** across 12 frameworks (SwiftUI, UIKit, React, Vue, Svelte, Angular, Jetpack Compose, Android XML, React Native, Flutter, CSS, and HTML) and reports concerns by severity — **critical / serious / moderate** — plus positive patterns you already follow.

Runs under Node 20+ (after install) or [Bun](https://bun.sh) (directly from source). Zero runtime dependencies.

## Usage

```bash
# Audit a project (one-off, no install)
npx hig-doctor ./path/to/project

# Or install globally
npm install -g hig-doctor
hig-doctor ./path/to/project
```

### Output modes

| Flag | Effect |
|------|--------|
| _(none)_ | Pretty terminal summary: per-category bars, severity counts, interpretation. |
| `--export` | Write a full markdown report to `hig-audit.md` in the audited directory. |
| `--stdout` | Print the full markdown report to stdout (pipe it to an AI agent). |
| `--json` | Emit machine-readable JSON to stdout (progress goes to stderr). For CI. |
| `--fail-on <level>` | Exit non-zero when a finding at or above `critical`, `serious`, or `moderate` exists. For CI gates. |
| `--fail-on-claims` | Exit non-zero when a declared Accessibility Nutrition Label claim scans as at-risk. See _Accessibility Nutrition Labels_. |
| `--exclude <glob>` | Skip paths matching a glob (comma-separated, repeatable). See _Ignoring files_. |

### CI gate example

```bash
# Fail the build on any accessibility-breaking (critical) violation
npx hig-doctor . --fail-on critical
```

```json
// JSON shape (abridged)
{
  "severities": { "critical": 0, "serious": 2, "moderate": 5 },
  "totals": { "concerns": 7, "positives": 41, "patterns": 88 },
  "categories": [ /* per-skill breakdown */ ]
}
```

## Ignoring files

Two mechanisms, combined:

1. **`.higauditignore`** at the audited directory root — one glob per line, `#` for comments. Same matching as `.gitignore`-style globs:
   - `*` matches within a path segment (does not cross `/`)
   - `**` matches any depth
   - a bare directory name prunes the whole subtree
2. **`--exclude <glob>`** on the command line — comma-separated, merged with the ignore file.

```
# .higauditignore — demo fixtures contain intentional violations
components/audit-demo-fixtures.ts
**/*.stories.tsx
examples
```

## What it detects

Each rule maps to a HIG topic (Accessibility, Color, Typography, Layout, Buttons, Navigation, Materials, …) and a severity:

- **Critical** — accessibility-breaking: images without alt text, `user-scalable=no`, removed focus outlines, click handlers on non-interactive elements.
- **Serious** — significant UX violations: hardcoded colors over semantic tokens, tap targets below minimum, deprecated navigation containers.
- **Moderate** — style-level: fixed font sizes, non-Dynamic-Type fonts, gesture-only affordances.

Detection is regex-based and self-contained — no network calls, no source ever leaves your machine.

## Accessibility Nutrition Labels

Every audit also scores readiness for all nine App Store accessibility claims
(VoiceOver, Voice Control, Larger Text, Dark Interface, Differentiate Without
Color Alone, Sufficient Contrast, Reduced Motion, Captions, Audio
Descriptions), built entirely from claim-tagged rule evidence gathered during
the same scan.

- Declare the claims you intend to make in `.hig-doctor/accessibility-claims.json`:
  ```json
  { "claims": ["voiceover", "larger-text"] }
  ```
- Gate CI with `--fail-on-claims` — it exits 1 when a **declared** claim scans as at-risk.
- These are heuristic signals, not certification. Verify manually with Accessibility
  Inspector and assistive technologies before declaring a claim in App Store Connect.

## From source (Bun)

```bash
git clone https://github.com/raintree-technology/hig-doctor.git
cd hig-doctor/packages/hig-doctor/src-termcast
bun install
bun run audit ../../..            # audit the repo itself
bun test                          # run the rule + scanner suite
```
