# Apple HIG Skills

Agent-native Apple Human Interface Guidelines: a structured index of Apple's HIG delivered as Claude Skills, with an MCP server and a universal compliance auditor as the verification loop. Built for AI coding agents; usable by humans.

- **Skills corpus** — 14 skills and 157 reference topics covering the complete HIG (foundations, components, patterns, inputs, platforms, technologies). Snapshot re-verified against the live HIG on 2026-07-08; includes the WWDC 2025 "Liquid Glass" overhaul and the WWDC 2026 / iOS 27 day-one updates (Siri AI, Snippets, reintroduced Design principles, Liquid Glass refinements). Canonical content remains at [developer.apple.com/design/human-interface-guidelines](https://developer.apple.com/design/human-interface-guidelines/).
- **MCP server** — stdio Model Context Protocol server exposing `hig_list_skills`, `hig_lookup`, and `hig_audit` for Claude Desktop, Cursor, Windsurf, and Claude Code.
- **Audit CLI** — universal HIG compliance scanner across 12 frameworks (SwiftUI, UIKit, React, Vue, Svelte, Angular, Compose, Android XML, React Native, Flutter, CSS, HTML). Emits severity-bucketed markdown/JSON with a pass/fail CI gate.

## Install as a Claude Code plugin

```bash
/plugin marketplace add raintree-technology/hig-doctor
```

Or add as a git submodule into any project's `.claude/` directory.

## MCP server

Expose the skills and audit tool to any MCP-compatible client.

```bash
# From a git clone of this repo
bun packages/hig-doctor/src-mcp/src/index.ts
```

Claude Desktop config (`~/Library/Application Support/Claude/claude_desktop_config.json`):

```json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "hig-doctor": {
      "command": "bun",
      "args": ["/absolute/path/to/hig-doctor/packages/hig-doctor/src-mcp/src/index.ts"]
    }
  }
}
```

Tools:

| Tool | Purpose |
|------|---------|
| `hig_list_skills` | Enumerate skills, descriptions, and reference topics. |
| `hig_lookup` | Fetch HIG reference markdown by skill (and optional topic). |
| `hig_audit` | Run the HIG compliance audit on a project directory. |

Set `HIG_SKILLS_DIR` if you relocate the `skills/` folder.

## HIG Audit CLI

Scan any project for Apple HIG compliance. Works with SwiftUI, UIKit, React, Next.js, Vue, Nuxt, Svelte, SvelteKit, Angular, React Native, Flutter, Jetpack Compose, Android XML, and plain HTML/CSS. Detects 359 patterns across accessibility, color systems, typography, responsive layout, dark mode, motion, i18n, and more.

Requires [Bun](https://bun.sh).

```bash
cd packages/hig-doctor/src-termcast
bun run audit <directory>
```

Example output:

```

```

### Options

| Flag | Description |
|------|-------------|
| `--export` | Write a full audit report to `<directory>/hig-audit.md` |
| `--stdout` | Print raw audit markdown to stdout (pipe to an AI for evaluation) |
| `--json` | Print structured results as JSON (for CI/scripts) |
| `--fail-on <severity>` | Exit 1 if any concern at/above `critical`, `serious`, or `moderate` is found |
| `--help` | Show help |

### Severity model

Concerns are classified as:

- **critical** — accessibility-breaking (missing alt, empty button, `user-scalable=no`, `<video>` without captions, etc.)
- **serious** — significant UX degradation (`div` with `onClick` and no role, positive tabindex, `outline: none` outside progressive enhancement, `onTapGesture` without traits, hover-without-focus, autoplay, etc.)
- **moderate** — HIG style/best-practice violations (hardcoded colors, deprecated components, `!important` usage, physical text-align, etc.)

Positive detections (semantic colors, Dynamic Type, accessibility modifiers, focus-visible, reduced-motion support) are tracked and reported but don't affect the gate.

### What it detects

The audit scans code, stylesheets, and config files, then categorizes findings across HIG areas:

- **Foundations** — semantic vs hardcoded colors, Dynamic Type vs fixed font sizes, dark mode, motion preferences, accessibility labels, focus management, heading hierarchy, landmark regions, touch targets, i18n/RTL support
- **Layout & Navigation** — navigation patterns, responsive breakpoints, semantic HTML, adaptive layout, sidebar/tab patterns
- **Controls** — buttons, toggles, form elements, interactive controls, labels
- **Content Display** — images, collections, tables, cards, accordions, lists
- **Input Methods** — keyboard support, gesture handling, form validation, input types, fieldset/legend, autocomplete
- **Interaction Patterns** — drag and drop, pull-to-refresh, undo, animations, haptics, error handling
- **Dialogs & Presentations** — modals, sheets, alerts, popovers, toasts, tooltips
- **Menus & Actions** — dropdown menus, context menus, toolbars, menu roles
- **Search & Navigation** — search fields, search roles, page controls
- **Status & Progress** — progress indicators, loading states, aria-busy
- **Apple Technologies** — WidgetKit, ActivityKit, HealthKit, ARKit, Apple Pay, Sign in with Apple

**Context-aware rules**: `!important` inside `@media print` and `prefers-reduced-motion` blocks is not flagged. `outline: none` inside `:focus:not(:focus-visible)` progressive enhancement is not flagged. Hover rules skip pseudo-element selectors like `::-webkit-scrollbar-thumb`. Test/spec files are excluded from scanning.

### GitHub Action

Audit on every pull request and fail the build on critical violations.

```yaml
- uses: actions/checkout@v4
- uses: raintree-technology/hig-doctor@main
  with:
    directory: .
    fail-on: critical
```

Outputs: `critical`, `serious`, `moderate`, `report` (path to generated `hig-audit.md`).

## Agent-readable surface

The [project website](https://apple.raintree.technology) serves:

- `/llms.txt` — structured index per the [llms.txt](https://llmstxt.org) convention, linking every HIG topic with excerpts.
- `/raw/<slug>` — plain-text markdown for each reference topic (scriptable retrieval).
- `/topics/<slug>` — HTML pages for humans.

## Remotion demo

An animated [Remotion](https://www.remotion.dev/) video that visualizes audit output with glass-card UI.

```bash
cd demos/remotion-hig-doctor
npm install
npm run preview   # preview in browser
npm run render    # out/hig-doctor-showcase.mp4 (1920x1080, 30fps, 21s)
```

## Content maintenance

Skills content is a snapshot taken 2026-06-11, re-verified and enriched 2026-07-08 (a full re-crawl found no Apple-side prose changes; the converter gained `tabNavigator`/`small`/`links` rendering, recovering the Dynamic Type size tables, tvOS grid specs, haptic-pattern definitions, and Resources video links). Refreshes are driven by the `scripts/hig-ingest/` pipeline, which walks Apple's static DocC render JSON (`developer.apple.com/tutorials/data/design/human-interface-guidelines/<slug>.json`) — the HIG pages are JS-rendered, but the underlying JSON is static and complete, so the scan is automatable end to end:

1. `crawl.py` — BFS-walks the JSON tree from the section roots, caches every topic, emits a manifest.
2. `diff.py` — diffs Apple's live topic set against the local corpus (added / removed / renamed).
3. `convert.py` — renders a topic's DocC JSON to reference markdown (full prose; imagery omitted).
4. `generate.py` — regenerates the whole corpus into a staging tree, reusing the existing slug→skill placement.

The `annual-hig-rescan.yml` workflow still opens a tracking issue each June after WWDC as a reminder to run the pipeline, review the diff, and tag a new release.

Each reference file carries an attribution block and canonical source URL in its frontmatter. Apple-hosted screenshots have been stripped to reduce IP transfer; retain the source link and open Apple's page when visual context is needed.
